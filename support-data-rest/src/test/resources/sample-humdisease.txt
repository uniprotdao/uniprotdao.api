ID   Acrokeratosis verruciformis.
AC   DI-00030
AR   AKV.
DE   A localized disorder of keratinization, which is inherited as an
DE   autosomal dominant trait. Its onset is early in life with multiple
DE   flat-topped, flesh-colored papules on the hands and feet, punctate
DE   keratoses on the palms and soles, with varying degrees of nail
DE   involvement. The histopathology shows a distinctive pattern of
DE   epidermal features with hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis and acanthosis
DE   together with papillomatosis. These changes are frequently associated
DE   with circumscribed elevations of the epidermis that are said to
DE   resemble church spires. There are no features of dyskeratosis or
DE   acantholysis, the typical findings in lesions of Darier disease.
